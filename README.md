/*
  Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was designed to take user input for an initial deposit, annual interst rate, amoount for each monthly deposit, and length of time in years.
Using this information, the program produced accurate output, showing how the account balance and interest would break-out over time. 

  What did you do particularly well?
I was surprised at how easily I was able to format the output. Usually this is a more difficult process for me in C++, but the output looked good, and the formulas nearly perfect on my first try.

  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Error-checking is implicit - I did not use try-catch, which is good practice, and can go a long way to making my code more reliable and secure.

  Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this?
I had some difficulty, initially, deciding how to modularize my code. I overcame this by writing a sort of rough flowchart, and focusing on the order in which I would write each component.

  What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
My GitHub account is over a year old now, but i have barely used it! I plan to use GitHub for each of my future projects, as habit, and as a means of keeping my code in the cloud, in case I ever want to look back, refactor for practice, or reude my code. I plan to get more involved in coding events, in order to increase my network and meet other coders.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project was good practice working with a real-workd banking and finance scenario. Many projects involve working with calculations involving money, so it is valuable experience moving forward.

  How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Keeping my code modular, making good use of indentation and whitespace, and passing values by reference, all assited me in keepin the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
